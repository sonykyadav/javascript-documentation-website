        <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, 
            and interpreted compiled programming language. It is also known as
            the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development
            of web pages, and many non-browser environments also use it.
        </p>
        <p>In this type of language we are concerned about how it is to be done,
            basically here logical computation requires. Her main goal is to describe
            the desired result without direct dictation on how to get it as the arrow function does</p>
            <ul>
                <li>With advances in browser technology and JavaScript having moved
                    into the server with Node.js and other frameworks, JavaScript is
                    capable of so much more. Here are a few things that we can do with JavaScript:</li>
                    <li>JavaScript was created in the first place for DOM manipulation.
                        Earlier websites were mostly static, after JS was created dynamic Web sites were made.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>According to a recent survey conducted by Stack Overflow, JavaScript is the most popular language on earth. </li>
                <li>Performs Form Validation although the forms are created using HTML.</li>
                <li>Functions in JS are objects. They may have properties and methods just like other objects.
                     They can be passed as arguments in other functions.</li>

            With advances in browser technology and JavaScript having moved into the
             server with Node.js and other frameworks, JavaScript is capable of so much more.
              Here are a few things that we can do with JavaScript: 
              <code>
                We can write JavaScript code in another files having an extension.js and then 
                link this file inside the  tag of the HTML file in which we want to add this code.
              </code>
              extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, and provide continuity of information

    <section id="Variables">
        <h2>Variables</h2>
        <article>
            <p>It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was an engineer at Netscape. 
                It was originally going to be named LiveScript but was renamed.</p>

            <p> In this type of language we are mostly concerned about how it is to be done.
                It simply controls the flow of computation. The procedural programming approach, 
                object, oriented approach comes under this as async await we are thinking about what
                is to be done further after the async call</p>
                
                <p>Unlike most programming languages, JavaScript language has no concept of input or output.
                    It is designed to run as a scripting language in a host environment, and it is up to the
                    host environment to provide mechanisms for communicating with the outside world. The most 
                    common host environment is the browser. </p>
